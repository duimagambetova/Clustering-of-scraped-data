# Clustering-of-scraped-data
This notebook is created to use the previous web scraped data from kazakh Q&amp;A website. It splits the data into train and tests and applies NLP techniques to cluster similar questions from train and test datasets, respectively.

For launching this code, it is needed to use previous script of WebScraping to retrieve the data in JSON files format.
